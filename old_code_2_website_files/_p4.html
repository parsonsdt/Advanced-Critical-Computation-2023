      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        What does it mean to design a camera that is meant to capture a specific
        person, place, or object in mind? <br />

        What does it mean to make a camera that is meant to capture bodies that
        are living under the coronavirus crisis?<br />

        How do we want to document our domestic life while we self-quarantine?
        <br />
        How can camera filters change the way we perceive ourselves and the
        others? <br />
        <br />

        For project #4, you will design and create an experimental camera with a
        specific purpose and usage in mind. Make an intentional choice on
        whether this camera will be used on a desktop or on a mobile device. The
        camera should inspire the user to capture images in new and surprising
        ways. You are expected to interact with the DOM, and use
        createGraphics() and / or loadPixels() in your camera design.

      <p>
        Whenever a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object
        Model (DOM) for the loaded page. DOM arranges all the elements on the
        web page into a tree diagram &mdash;
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_htmltree.gif" />
      </div>
      <p>
        And the amazing part is, we can interact with the elements on this tree
        diagram from our sketch.js! If you visit the p5 refrence's
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#group-DOM">DOM section</a>, you
        will find a number of

      <div id="clm"><h2>clmtrkr.js</h2></div>

      <p>
        Many of you are curious about exploring facial recognition for this
        project, so I'm adding a chapter on
        <a href="https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr">clmtrkr.js</a>, a
        JavaScript library that can be easily intergrated into p5.js. You can
        use it to create AR face filters, analyze facial expressions, or even
        <a
          href="https://yp.scmp.com/article/115418/10-instagram-secret-filter-games-play-right-now"
          >use your face as an input to play a game</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        This might sound complicated, but the good news is the mechanism
        actually works very similarly to the textToPoints() function we've
        already worked with in Project #2. Instead of translating text into an
        array of x and y, clmtrkr.js helps translating our facial contour into a
        sequence of points &mdash;
      </p>

      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img src="https://www.auduno.com/images/annotated2_small.jpg" />
        <img
          src="https://www.auduno.com/clmtrackr/docs/media/facemodel_numbering_new_small.png"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        What's convenient is that clmtrkr will always generate a total of 70
        points around the face, so if you want to draw something on the tip of
        the nose it will always be point 62, the left eye and the right eye will
        always be point 27 and 32.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to learn more about how clmtrkr works behind the scene, I'd
        recommend checking out this
        <a href="https://www.auduno.com/2014/01/05/fitting-faces/">blog post</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Setting up clmtrkr.js in the p5 Editor
      </h3>

      <p>
        Let's use this
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/EDqEwgAul"
          >code template</a
        >
        as a starting point. It includes what we've gone through in the
        createCapture() section above. To add the clmtrkr.js library into your
        p5 sketch, you'd want to open your index.html page and insert the
        library before your p5 library:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/e91b73dcc33c6d24525ee1f27a7bcffa.js"></script>

      <p>
        Next let's open sketch.js and create a global variable
        <i>let tracker</i> at the top of the sketch. And let's also add line
        12~14 from the code example below into your setup(). I will give a brief
        explanation of what each of those lines does next to the code, but if
        you want to dig deeper please check out clmtrkr's
        <a href="https://www.auduno.com/clmtrackr/docs/reference.html"
          >reference page</a
        >.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/3a647090fe1d682ebde4d040b7fc3831.js"></script>

      <p>
        You've initated the clmtrackr object, but nothing is happening on the
        screen yet. Let's add this important line in draw() so that the tracking
        points will be continuously updated when the program runs.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/f4ebf46ababda6acfb4a2483fa87da03.js"></script>

      <p>
        Now all the tracking points would be stored inside <i>positions</i>.
        Next, let's add the block of code below into draw(). Using beginShape()
        and endShape(), we can connect all the tracking points together to draw
        and outline of the face!
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/2eab5fe6150eff7002aefc372e2d54a8.js"></script>
      <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/-gbq9sNsC"
        >Source Code</a
      >

      <p>
        Now keep your face in the center of frame and make sure that your face
        is fairly well lit. If you see an overlayed white outline around your
        face, then congrats! You've got a basic facial recognition system in
        your p5 sketch.
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-04-04%20at%204.00.14%20PM.png?v=1586030463124"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Now, we've entered an uncharted territory here. What's actually inside
        <i>positions</i>? What is the two-bracket business in
        <i>positions[i][0]</i> and <i>positions[i][1]</i> all about? Hum, let's
        print <i>positions</i> in draw() to take a peak at what's inside the
        variable:
      </p>
      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/a1ab72f59df25c454de0c030d7cba363.js"></script>
      <p>
        When you hit play, you should see something like this inside your
        console:
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-04-04%20at%201.56.40%20PM.png?v=1586026141160"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        And if you stop the sketch and click on the tiny arrow in front of each
        print, you should be able to look inside of the structure and see
        something like this:
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-04-04%20at%202.48.29%20PM.png?v=1586026141066"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        This is a new data structure that we haven't talked about in this class.
        It's got a fancy name &mdash; the two-dimensional array.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Two-Dimensional Array
      </h3>

      <p>
        So far we have mostly been working with one-dimensional array. If we
        compare writing an array to making a list, the list version of
        <i>let groceries = [“pasta”, “dumplings”, “bread”]</i> would look like
        this
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal">Pasta</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal">Dumpling</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal">Bread</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        However, if I really shop for those groceries in real life, I'd probably
        need to create a sublist under every food item, detailing what
        ingredients I need. And this is what two-dimensional array allows us to
        do &mdash; we can add an additional sublist to an exisiting list.
        Essentially, tw-dimensional array is an array of an array; a list of a
        list.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-weight: bold;">Pasta</li>
        <ol>
          <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">Tomato</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">Basil</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">Spaghetti</li>
        </ol>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-weight: bold;">Dumpling</li>
        <ol>
          <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">Dumpling wrapper</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">Cabbage</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">Ground pork</li>
        </ol>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-weight: bold;">Bread</li>
        <ol>
          <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">Flour</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">Yeast</li>
        </ol>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Let's apply these concepts to p5. If I were to create a pizza ordering
        progarm that lets my customers choose their own toppings using a
        one-dimensional array, it would look like this:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/0b7784cc40a1bdbadd496937b8d7538f.js"></script>

      <p>
        And in a two-dimensional array it would look like this:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/d932dff09f751b807477c0636bdac340.js"></script>

      <p>
        I've snuck in a neat trick, <i>console.table()</i> in the code. Hit play
        and see a surprise in the console :)
      </p>

      <p>
        Most importantly, how do we order a specific pizza topping from
        <i>array2D</i>? If you'd like to order a plain bread, you would type
        this into the program:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/f8ce75047435a7f47be10d9af72be242.js"></script>
      <p>
        Now here's a coding challenge for you &mdash; make the console print out
        "I'd like a pizza with whole wheat bread, red sauce, mushrooms with
        mozzarella and goat cheese". If you get stuck, check out the answer
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/w2axyYNwY">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Adding AR Overlay
      </h3>

      <p>
        Finally, let's return to looking at the two-dimensional arrays inside
        the
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/-gbq9sNsC"
          >clmtrackr exmple</a
        >. It turns out that under every tracking point, there is an [x, y]
        array that store the x and y values of each tracking point. By writing
        <i>positions[62][0]</i> we get to access the x value of tracking point
        number 62, and by writing <i>positions[62][1]</i> we access the y value.
      </p>

      <p>
        Knowing this, let try something fun by adding this block of code to the
        clmtrackr example inside draw():
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/191bb94a848505f2ca3542557453d331.js"></script>

      <p>
        If you see a circle popping up in front of your nose, hooray!
      </p>
      <p>
        You might ask why we need to add an IF statement that checks whether
        <i>positions.length</i> is larger than 0. If you try to comment that out
        you will get an immediate error when the program starts. The reason for
        this is because it takes a second for the program to register your face.
        Without the IF statement, the program would try to access the
        <i>positions</i> data without actually having the data, causing the
        program to crash.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the sake of organization, the next thing we could do now is to add
        dots and numbers to the sketch to show where each tracking points are on

        Here's an example of how you would analyze someone's smile &mdash; add
        this block of code into your existing clmtrakr sketch:

      >

      <p>
        If you try out the sketch, you'd see that this idea of "emotional
        analysis" is actually extremely superficial. Essentially, you are just
        comparing the distance and relationship between two or more tracking
        points on the face. Try adding your own feature, such as making the bar
        grow if your eyebrow raises. Try to find creative and surprising ways to
        work with the technique.
      </p>

      <div id="cg"><h2>createGraphics()</h2></div>

      <p>
        Remember when you first learned about the background() function in p5,
        and you had to choose between leaving a trail of ellipses on the screen
        when you moved your mouse around versus clearing the background and
        leaving only one ellipse on the screen? Well, those days are officially
        over &mdash;
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createGraphics"
          >createGraphics()</a
        >
        give you the ability create multiple layers on top of your canvas. You
        could do things such as assigning a background() to the bottom layer and
        no background for the top layer; or cut part of a layer and paste it
        onto a new layer. This is pretty much the closest to Photoshop we're
        ever going to get in p5.js!
      </p>

      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img style="height:100px" src="https://i.imgur.com/34MoKlQ.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Just like createCanvas(), createGraphics() is a
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Element">p5.elements</a> that
        is usually initiated in setup():

      <p>
        The line <i>layer1.ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 25, 25)</i> assigns
        <i>ellipse()</i> as a child of <i>layer1</i>. There are many other p5
        functions that could be assigned as children of the layers, check out

      <div id="copy"><h2>copy()</h2></div>

      <p>
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/copy">copy()</a> is a p5
        function that lets you copy and paste a specific region of the canvas.
        Like the good ol' days of Photoshop. This is the syntax for copy():
      </p>
      <h5>
        copy(srcImage, sx, sy, sw, sh, dx, dy, dw, dh)
      </h5>
      <p>
        As you can see, there are nine parameters inside the copy function! This
        may seem daunting at first, but once you understand what each of them do
        it is actually pretty straight forward. Let's break them down one by
        one:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          (1) srcImage: source image. This can be an image you upload, or an
          image generated by createImage(), createGraphics(), or createCapture()
        </li>
        <li>(2) sx: source image's x coordinate</li>
        <li>(3) sy: source image's y coordinate</li>
        <li>(4) sw: source image width</li>
        <li>(5) sh: source image height</li>
        <li>(6) dx: destination image's x coordinate</li>
        <li>(7) dy: destination image's y coordinate</li>
        <li>(8) dw: destination image width</li>
        <li>(9) dh: destination image height</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Now let's put it into practice. Download this

          >seaside photo</a
        >
        and upload it to your p5 sketch. Here's a
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/image">reminder</a> for
        displaying an uploaded image in your editor.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal we have here is to copy the goats from the original image and
        paste it to a different location on the canvas. In the example below, I
        have copied two goats for you. Could you try to copy a different goat?
      </p>

        Once you've done it yourself, you might notice that even though our
        canvas is at 400px by 400px, we might need to set our source X and
        source Y above 400. Do you have an idea for why that may be?
      </p>

      <p>
        Tips: you could use
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/imageMode">imageMode()</a> to
        let the progam know whether to treat the CENTER or the UPPER LEFT of the
        image as (0,0).

      <p>
        Now that we know how copy() works, let's combine it with createCapture()
        and make a real-time pixelator!
      </p>

      <p>
        Pixelation happens when a raster image is enlarged to the point where
        individual pixels are revealed, resulting in blurriness and fuzziness in
        the image. Based on this principle, we can stretch and displace regions
        of an image to create a pixelated effect. We will use a nested for loop
        to copy a grid from the source image and paste the grid onto the canvas.
      </p>

      <h2>
        loadPixels()
      </h2>

      <h2>
        set() and get()
      </h2>

      <p>
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/set">set()</a> and
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/get">get()</a> are easy-to-use
        functions that let you directly interact with the pixels on your canvas.
        set() lets you write pixels to the canvas and get() lets you read
        pixels() from the canvas.
      </p>

      <h5>
        set(x, y, c)
      </h5>

      <p>
        In order to use set(), you would need to specify which x, y positions
        you would like to place the pixel in, and what color you would like the
        pixel to use.
      </p>

      <h5>
        get(x, y)
      </h5>

      <p>
        In order to use get() you first need to make sure that the canvas isn't
        empty. Specify the x and y of the pixel you would like to read, and a
        color value will return which you could use for something else in your
        sketch.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What's Inside a Pixel?
      </h3>

      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img
          src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Pixel_geometry_01_Pengo.jpg"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Every pixel on your screen contains an array of [R, G, B, A]. R stands
        for red, G stands for green, B stands for blue, and A stands for the
        alpha channel, which controls opacity. Let's write a few lines of code
        so that we could read the array of a pixel in our console:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/2efbfb6b2861ea531de832458155b0dc.js"></script>

      <p>
        If you print <i>c</i> into the console, you would see an array of four
        different values, each representing the R, G, B, and Alpha channel of
        the single pixel that is right underneath the tip of the cursor. Since
        we've set the background to green, getting the pixel at any part of the
        canvas is going to give us a reading of <i>[0, 255, 0, 255]</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's move forward to a more nuanced example using the seaside photo as
        the background. I'm also using <i>mouseX</i> and <i>mouseY</i> as the x
        and y values in get(), so that when you hover over the screen, you would
        see the color of the pixel you're hovering over displayed inside the
        square &mdash;
      </p>

      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/RkoemCNwi"></iframe>
      <p>&#8627; hover over the screen to pick a color from the image</p>

        >Source Code</a
      >

      <p>
        Here's another example that uses both set() and get():
      </p>

      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/VemrYWnSS"></iframe>

      <p>
        As you can see, I've placed the get inside set(), so that everytime
        set() is executed, it loads get() which finds anoter pixel at a relative
        position to grab.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Make a Pointillist Filter
      </h3>

      <p>
        Next, let's create an experimental camera that will render the subject
        as a pointillist portrait. We will combine createCapture() + get() to
        acheive the effect.
      </p>

      <h2>
        loadPixels() and updatePixels()
      </h2>

      <p>
        In the last section we have covered the fact that every pixel contains
        an array of [R, G, B, A] values. Now we are going to talk about
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pixels">pixels[]</a>, which is
        another way to <i>write</i> pixel values into your program. Its purpose
        is identical to set(), however the performance speed is faster, and
        that's useful for when you need to make a lot of modifications to the
        pixel array.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Pixel Array
      </h3>

      <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/N0jYFxmDS"></iframe>
      <p>
        In this example, we will combine pixel[] and a nested for Loop to create
        a gradient image as shwon above. But first, you should call
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadPixels">loadPixels()</a>
        in the beginning of draw() and
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/updatePixels"
          >updatePixels()</a
        >
        at the end of draw(). These functions help loading the displaying the
        pixels onto the canvas.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/c6a29744cd013405aaaf31de1232d86f.js"></script>

      <p>
        And now here's the fun part. We're going to use a nested for Loop to
        draw a grid of pixels. And we're going to use <i>let index</i> to count
        every row of the pixel grid.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/2d5969cdb26b8662b9d95257cae1bb72.js"></script>

      <p>
        If you're confused by what's going on inside the for Loop, here's a
        thorough
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUMZ5YRxHI">tutorial</a> that
        explains what it means.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now if you have a high pixel density display such as a retina screen,
        when you click on play you will see the pixels only filling part of the
        screen instead of all of the screen. Because by default, pixel density
        in p5 is set to match the display density.
      </p>

      <div class="full-width-box">
        <img

        />
      </div>

      <p>
        To make the pixel density in p5 adopt to your display density, you would
        have to set
        <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pixelDensity"
          >pixelDensity()</a
        >

        By combining the pixel array example with createCapture(), you could
        create a rainbow gradient filter similar to the ones you see in social

        the user can adjust the level of redness in the image:

      <h3>Setting Up Your Work Environment</h3>
      <p>
        You can make your coding experience a lot smoother and save a lot of
        time by setting up a healthy work environment. For example, when you're
        working with nested for Loop, it's a very good idea to draw and number
        all the grid cells on your canvas as things can get confusing really
        quickly. Here's a
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/ujBIbOWPj">template</a>
        I've created to help you get started. <br />
      </p>
      <div class="full-width-box">
        <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/ujBIbOWPj"></iframe>
        <p>
          In the source code, you'd see that I have created a grid using a
          nested for Loop:
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/e49a9df08408b9758a2959078ffb4121.js"></script>
        <p>
          By looking at the numbers labeled on each and every cell, I can
          instruct the program to draw a diagonal line onto row 1, column 1 on
          the grid by adding <code><b>if(i == 1 && j == 1)</b></code> in the
          nested for loop. <br />

          The <b>const cellnum</b> variable defines the number of rows and
          columns and <b>const g</b> defines the width and height of the cells.
          When you use the template, change the values of these variables to
          draw a grid based on your own design needs.
