Course Descriptions
------------

Code 2 is a continuation of the principles and techniques taught in Code 1. Students will expand their conceptual and technical skills in the pursuit of mastering code and procedurality as a tool for creative, critical, and aesthetic exploration and expression. The class content will focus on building more complex systems and exploring specific creative applications of code. Topics will include algorithms, object-oriented programming, and the historical and cultural context of software in art and design. Students will work with p5.js to produce creative work, culminating in a final project engaging with an aspect of the course content in detail.

Learning Outcomes
------------

1. Demonstrate knowledge and application of fundamental programming skills in p5.js.
1. Develop a deep understanding of the relationship between code and design.
1. Manipulate data and text critically, via APIs, databases, and regular expressions.
1. Critically discuss and create work drawing from historical precedents of computational literature, critical design, and data visualization, as well as understanding the Internet as a site for potential intervention.
