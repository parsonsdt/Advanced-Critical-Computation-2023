          &mdash; Theorizing the Web is an inter- and non-disciplinary annual
          conference that brings together scholars, journalists, artists,
          activists, and technology practitioners to think conceptually and
          critically about the interrelationships between the Web and society.
          We deeply value public engagement, and consider insights from
          academics, non-academics, and non-“tech theorists” alike to be equally
          valuable.
