          <h2>Description</h2>
    
          <p>
            In your final project, you will be tasked with using older HTML/CSS concepts such as DOM elements: input, forms, and buttons, and newer Javascript concepts like localStorage, to create an interactive quiz or tool! 
<br><br>
While your quiz or tool can be about anything, it must center a specific group/demographic/community and providing some kind of experience or opportunity to the group. You can choose to define that community and what it means for you, on your own terms. Just be sure and explicit about who it is for, and why you’re making it.
<br><br>
It is best to center a group that you have DIRECT relationships with and not make assumptions about other groups. Nevertheless, we encourage you to research your chosen group as to not solely rely on your own lived experiences and assumptions about what the potential need or opportunity may be. You’ll want to define the challenge and use your quiz or tool as potential, feasible solution that addresses some or all of that challenge. 

          </p>
          <p>Technical Requirements</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Your Quiz should have at least  8 questions</li>
            <li>Have user input through form elements and event handlers (think: buttons!)</li>
            <li>Store user input using local storage </li>
            <li>Taking those locally stored answers and using them to change aspects of the webpage </li>
            <li>Work locally with HTML, CSS & Javascript</li>
            <li>Store your code cleanly in a Github Repository </li>
            <li>Testing & documenting your quiz with users</li>
            <li>Have a well documented README.md file highlighting your design process, inspiration and references, challenges you faced and next steps for the project if you had more time to complete it and create a second version.</li>

          </ol>
