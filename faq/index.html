            Advanced Advanced Critical Computation is more focused and project driven than Critical Computation. The extent at which we collaborate with our peers will be confined to in-group activities, peer reviews or other in-class touchpoints. 

            However, we encourage you to get to know your peers and create a support network amongst each other outside of class time! 
          </li>
          <li><h3>How are the readings & the assignments linked?</h3></li>
          <li>
            TLDR; All the assignments are designed to be open-ended. We have our
            own ideas of how the two connect, but we would love to see you
            connect the dots through your own reflection on the readings and
            apply them into the assignments in ways that’s creative and
            empowering for you.<br /><br />The long answer: as a course that
            values code, design, and criticality equally, we shouldn't wait to
            explore some of the most urgent issues in contemporary computing
            &mdash; this includes developing critical thinking skills around
            algorithms, AI, biometric surveillance, and evaluating the impacts
            of machine learning and networking. However this doesn't mean we are
            ready to build an artificial intelligence (yet). Learning to code
            takes time and we need to be patient and build technical knowledge
            from the ground up and make sure that the process of learning is
            inclusive of everyone in this class. <br /><br />The open-ended
            nature of the assignments imply that you can take them into any
            number of directions that fits your skill-level and background. In
            addition, once we finish midterm and start working with external
            APIs, you will begin to find many direct relationships between the
            readings and the assignments.

              Are we limited to only using P5.js this semester?
            </h3>
          </li>
          <li>
            We will continue to build on the object-oriented-programming foundation and interactivity on the web from Adv. CC this semester, however you will be able to bring in other libraries or functionality to augment the abilities of P5.js. 
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>
              Are we required to use the p5.js web editor or can we use our own
              IDE?
            </h3>
          </li>
          <li>
            You're welcomed to use your own IDE, however due to the size of this
            class, please make it very easy for the instructors / DT tutors to
            view your p5 sketches in the browser, so that no additional copying
            / pasting / downloading is required on our end.
          </li>

            <h3>
              Can we use other programming languages to complete some of our
              assignments?
            </h3>
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have previous knowledge in programming, you can use other
            languages as long as you're still including p5.js and working in the
            web context. So additional HTML / CSS / Javascript / external JS
            libraries are acceptable. If you do decide to go this route though,
            just know that our capacity to support something that's outside of
            the scope of this class might be limited.

           We would like to suggest that you credit as many sources as it is possible. Lauren McCarthy, the creator and former project lead for p5.js said that it is important to "reinforce the idea that all of this work is built on collaboration and sharing open-source tools. It's very different from the individual genius artist in their studio framework of the art world". <br><br> If you're remixing someone else's code outside of the tutorial context, please make sure you don't use code that doesn't have an open-sourced license such as the <a href="https://mit-license.org/">MIT license</a> or the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU license</a>. And it's best practice that you list their license type in your attribution, e.g. "This project is licensed under a GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1".<br><br>
            In concrete terms, you can credit your sources <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/zjeoOQO0l">at the top of your source code</a> as well as on your <a href="https://code-portfolio-template.glitch.me/p1.html">portfolio pages</a>. Click on the links to see the examples.

          <li>
Adv. CC faculty have been teaching / learning remotely since Spring, 2020, and based on our experience, it makes a great difference when everyone can keep their cameras on, so that at the very least we can be pixel-present. We'd like to be accommodating and supportive as long as it's within reasons, so if you have a specific reason as to why you'd prefer to keep your camera off, please contact your instructor to discuss further.
