          “Typography has something of a split personality &#8212; it’s both the
          technical act of writing words into the world by giving them form, and
          it’s also a way of understanding the world through the form of its
          writing.” <br /><br />

        <h2>Description</h2>
  
        <p>
          The look of a word has an enormous impact on how we understand the word.
          For centuries, calligraphers and typographers have explored and developed different ways
          to make type more expressive. Living in an era where computer
          programming has become increasingly accessible to designers, typography
          has adopted the principles of modular and parameterized design and
          became more interactive.<br /><br />
          For Project #1, you will pick three different words to create three
          interactive posters. Incorporate textToPoints() and / or classes and
          objects in the sketches. Your choice of shape, color, motion, and
          interaction should thoughtfully reflect on the meaning of the word.

          is a method in p5 that converts text into points on the screen. It’s an
          exciting feature that will allow us to manipulate type in new and
          surprising ways. In order for textToPoints() to work, you have to use a
          specific font format called OpenType font (OTF) in your sketches. Here
          are a couple direct links for you to download OTF fonts:

          Loading Font
        </h3>
  
        <p>
          Once you download the files to your computer, open the p5 web editor. Go
          to Sketch &gt; Add File and drag an OTF file to the dialogue box. Once
          it’s uploaded you should see the file showing up in your sketch folder
          on the left side of the editor.

          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Now to load the font file, you need to create a global variable to hold
          the font and also load the font file from the preload() function.
          Comparable to setup() and draw(), the preload() function makes sure that
          your font is loaded before the browser loads the rest of the website.
          <br />
          <br />
          The preload() function should be placed before the setup() function. And
          inside setup(), you should load the <i>grotesk</i> variable inside
          <i>textFont()</i>. This tells the program that you will be using Grotesk
          as your default font.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/044b9377547ce54ebf49269a3cd38a9c.js"></script>
  
        <h3>
          Displaying Font
        </h3>
  
        <p>
          Once you have your OTF font loaded we can begin to display it. You can
          simply do this by adding this line in your draw():
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/1068ef1f0b4c11223f722c6a93b1be31.js"></script>
  
        <p>
          Now let's intergrate textToPoints() into the progarm and convert the
          pre-exisiting vertices inside our word into points. <br /><br />
          To do this, you will need to create a new variable that holds the
          textToPoints() array:
        </p>
  
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/69247c6c1441f18fc65f419086674b4d.js"></script>
  
        <p>
          There are five parameters inside the textToPoints function here. Let's
          break it down one by one:
        </p>
  
        <ul>
          <li>(1) txt: the first parameter takes a string of text</li>
          <li>(2) x: the second parameter takes a x position value</li>
          <li>(3) y: the third parameter takes a y position value</li>
          <li>(4) fontSize: the forth parameter takes a font size value</li>
          <li>
            (5) sampleFactor: the fifth parameter is the most important one to
            understand here. It defines how many points to draw along the text.
            The defacult value is 0.1, the higher number you enter here results in
            higher resolution, and lower number results in lower resolution
          </li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>
          Now if you print the variable <i>hiArray</i> in the program, you are
          going to get a funny message in the p5 console:
        </p>
        <div class="full-width-box">
          <img
            style="height:200px"
            src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-05%20at%201.40.37%20PM.png?v=1580928078985"
          />
        </div>
  
        <p>
          Let's open Chrome's built-in debugging console to take a deeper look at
          these objects. You can open the console by going to View &gt; Develper
          &gt; JavaScript Console.
        </p>
        <div class="full-width-box">
          <img
            style="height:200px"
            src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2FScreen%20Shot%202020-02-05%20at%201.48.19%20PM.png?v=1580928597513"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          Turns out that our <i>hiArray</i> variable has taken all the verticies
          from the text and turned it into an array of objects. Each of these
          objects inside the array contains a variable x, a variable y, and a
          variable alpha. Being able to access these variables mean that we can
          also alter and manipulate them to make interactive type. Amazing!
          <br /><br />
  
          We have created a bunch of variables in the program, but we haven't
          drawn anything on the canvas yet. Since <i>hiArray</i> is simply an
          array of objects that contain all the x and y values we need to display
          the text, we can use a for Loop to pull all the x and y values out of
          <i>hiArray</i> to draw ellipses:
        </p>
        <div class="full-width-box">
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/6eb2b2befa0e83f7a6af86999c9a1976.js"></script>

          >Link to Source Code</a
        >
  
        <p>
          You can do A LOT by combining what you've learned so far. Try changing
          the ellipse into other types of 2D primitives and begin code sketching
          and creating iterations. Check out more examples

        <h3>Changing Number of Verticies</h3>
  
        <p>
          Once you've gotten comfortable with the ideas above, let's try changing
          the number of verticies in your text. This can be achieved simply by
          changing the sampleFactor parameter inside textToPoints():
        </p>
        <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/4jQwsJvN"></iframe>
        <p>&#8627; use UP / DOWN keys to adjust the number of verticies.</p>
  
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/cb4c7a6e979a9c76f3b88fe7afc31602.js"></script>
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/4jQwsJvN"
          >Link to Source Code</a
        >
  
        <p>
          When you make changes to sampleFactor, just keep in mind that it's very
          sensitive, and most of the time you'd only want to make changes that are
          within a decimal range.
        </p>
  
        <h3>Connecting the Verticies using beginShape() and endShape()</h3>
  
        <p>
          You might remember this childhood game called Connect the Dots. It is a
          form of puzzle containing a sequence of numbered dots. When a line is
          drawn the outline of an image is revealed.
        </p>
        <div class="full-width-box">
          <img
            src="https://cdn.glitch.com/5dd99b18-3ebb-45c5-90fb-b4b67dc2e128%2Fcoloring4all-connect-the-dots-online-5a9ed8e88023b90036ec18e2.jpg?v=1581095294115"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          textToPoints() operates on a similar logic &mdash; it reveals the dots
          that crawl along the shape of the text. So what if you want to connect
          all the verticies together using an outline? A great p5 feature we could
          use here is something called
          <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/beginShape"
            >beginShape() and endShape()</a
          >. These are magical functions that connect verticies into a complex
          shape. Usually it is written this way:

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/ccf95d1b4df306085e4617dca00a4209.js"></script>
  
        <p>
          But since we already have all the x and y information we need contained
          inside the <i>hiArray</i> variable, we could just plug that information
          into <i>vertex(x,y)</i>. <br /><br />Here's how you would write it:
        </p>
  
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/0882b4ed59087d0c575c064890cea1f6.js"></script>
  
        <p>
          And it creates this!

        <p>
          As you can see, beginShape() and endShape() treats both "h" and "i" as
          one shape and attempts to connect both together. If you'd like the two
          to be separated, you have to create two individual textToPoints arrays
          to separate the "h" and the "i".

          Now that you know how to change the number of verticies in a letter and
          using beginShape() and endShape() to connect the dots, we are going to
          try something exciting. What about creating a morphing effect that would
          transform one letter into another letter? <br />

          There are a couple steps we need to take here. First, load and display
          your OTF font. Then create two empty array global varialbes at the top
          to hold our textToPoinst() objects. This way we can access the objects
          outside of <i>setup()</i> later. <br />
          <br />
          Next, we have to make sure that the number of verticies in the first
          letter matches the number of verticies in the second letter, so that
          each vertex has an ending position to move towards. We will achieve this
          by tweaking the sampleFactor values of the letter one and letter two
          until they match. Note that whenever you change the font size or the
          string, the number of verticies on your text will change.
        </p>
  
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/eda5b96b671aebdcde01e820435ddc63.js"></script>
  
        <p>
          Now, let's use the beginShape() technique we've learned from the
          previous chapter to connect all the verticies around the first letter
          inside draw().
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/558b6fee2ed7bb391f81691aa307819a.js"></script>
  
        <p>
          The next step is to make all the x and y in the first letter to move
          towards all the x and y inside the second letter. We can do this through
          if statements.
        </p>

          Using loop() and noLoop() to Start / Pause the Sketch
        </h3>
        <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/ghTSEmT6"></iframe>
        <p>&#8627; click to begin morphing; click to pause transformation</p>
        <p>
          We have been taught that draw() runs a loop and executes the code
          repetitively. However there is a way to pause draw() and start it again
          by using
          <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noLoop">noLoop()</a> and
          <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loop">loop()</a>. <br /><br />
  
          Try adding this line at the bottom of your setup():
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/aac9200a3daf161ee787880646531e67.js"></script>
        <p>
          Your sketch should draw the first letter but stop after that. This means
          the code inside draw() has been executed once but won't be looping. Now
          let's incroporate a mousePressed() function so that the sketch would
          start looping when mouse is pressed.
        </p>
  
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/e8aa21260efd8a863e6147b341caf3b3.js"></script>
  
        <p>
          The <i>play</i> boolean variable is initated as <i>false</i>, and when
          mouse is pressed, <i>play</i> becomes true. And if statement follows it
          to make draw() loops if <i>play</i> becomes <i>true</i>. Sweet!
        </p>

        <div id="class"><h2>textToPoints() + Classes and Objects</h2></div>
  
        <iframe src="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/embed/pqrsbqcl"></iframe>
        <p>&#8627; click to "mop" the screen</p>
  
        <p>
          There are a couple benefits to combining textToPoints() with classes and
          objects. First of all, it could help with code organization. Secondly,
          you could add additional "behaviors" inside the classes which would be
          inherited by the objects, and each object can operate individually. If
          you need a refresher on how classes and objects work, check out this
          <a href="p5cheat.html">cheat sheet</a> or this
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-HGdc8L-7w">video tutorial</a
          >.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Now let's re-create the "MOP" sketch above. After loading and displaying
          an OTF font in a new sketch. Create a class below
          <i>draw()</i>:
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/f39b6ac87a2bfe52b64802771ce3873c.js"></script>
        <p>
          Notice that I've created two parameters <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> inside the
          constructor argument. Once we create an array of objects in the next
          step, we will take the x and y values from the textToPoints() array and
          pass them into constructor(). I've also created a show() method inside
          the class. We will be using these rectangles to draw the outline of the
          first alphabet.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          The next step is to create a global variable that is an empty array, to
          hold the objects for <i>class Alphabet1</i>:
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/60cc1bbc6b9c3b15b4ab4f1f923351a4.js"></script>
  
        <p>
          And create an array of objects inside setup() after textToPoints() is
          declared. This is where we pass the x and y values from textToPoints()
          into the constructor argument.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/f3a48ab76f146cd7a004e9369b537773.js"></script>
  
        <p>
          The next step is to show the text outline on screen. Let's create
          another for Loop inside draw(), and place
          <i>_alphabet1[i].show()</i> inside the loop:
        </p>
  
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/be41dbc4f0c64f9ee0d4b1acf0aaf4d9.js"></script>
        <p>
          You should see your first alphabet displayed on the screen. We've
          successfully "borrowed" the array of x and y from textToPoints() and
          plugged them into class and objects. Here is
          <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/xinxin/sketches/zm_-6pJJ"
            >a link to all the code I've written so far</a
          >.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          There are three alphabets in this example &mdash; "M", "O", "P". We have
          finished the setup for M. The next challenge is for you to repeat the
          steps to set up O and P. Don't forget to adjust the
          <i>sampleFactor</i> for each of the letter so that the numbers of
          verticies match.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          ... ... ...
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Once you're done with that, let's begin to code our M &mdash; O
          transformation. This works the same way as the previous morphing
          tutorial, except for the sake of organization, I'm going to place this
          block of code a function called <i>morph1</i>.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/49fa9bf06e2b129ce935d2cbaceef867.js"></script>
  
        <p>
          Load <i>morph1()</i> inside draw() and you should see M morphing into O.
          Your next challenge is to repeat the steps and create the O &mdash; P
          transformation inside <i>morph2()</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          ... ... ...
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, let's use the switch statement we've learned from Project #1 as a
          means to advance the letter morphing on mousePressed():
        </p>
  
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/e63800e83015b4a177cf844530ade2d5.js"></script>
  
        <p>
          Now you should be able to morph from M &mdash; O &mdash; P. But for an
          interactive project to be effective and not look broken, you should find
          a way for P to loop back to M instead of stopping. Can you figure out
          how to make the sketch loop? (hint: there are more than one answers)

        <h2>Adding Behaviors</h2>
        
        <p>
          Now that you know how to combine textToPoints() with classes and
          objects, you can reflect on the different amazing things you did with
          classes and objects in Code 1 and think about the behaviors you could
          add onto your prototypes. Here's an example that uses dist() to contain
          a swarm of circles inside the text:

          makes it very easy to remove, add and swap objects inside an array. The
          syntax for splice() is:
        </p>
  
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/eb2347b3570d9a86c88fc6cc781fb7f9.js"></script>
        <p>
          There are three parameters inside splice(). Let's break it down one by
          one:
        </p>
  
        <ul>
          <li>(1) start: the index at which to start changing the array.</li>
          <li>
            (2) deleteCount: the number of items to remove from the array. Put 0
            here if you don't want to remove an item.
            <b>This parameter is optional.</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            (3) item1, item2 ...: The elements to add to the array, beginning from
            start. If you do not specify any elements, splice() will only remove
            elements from the array. <b>This parameter is optional.</b>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>&#8627; click to remove / replenish ellipses</p>
        <p>
          When you want to remove objects from an array, you only need to use the
          first and second parameters in splice(). For example, here's a row of
          ellipses created using class and objects:
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/2f5ae442a42c3b4867358cce50fa8aba.js"></script>
  
        <p>
          Let's add a mousePressed function, so that every time mouse is pressed,
          an ellipse is removed from the array.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/5363e03dedc6b5f15863231597f483df.js"></script>
        <p>
          Great! Now let's iterate the code so that when all the ellipses are
          removed from the array, we replenish the ellipses by re-creating the
          array of objects.
        </p>

          When you want to swap objects inside an array, you will indicate the
          number of arrays you want to remove in the second parameter and enter
          object(s) in the third parameter and beyond. In this example we want to
          create a <i>class Bubble</i> and a <i>class Box</i>, each producing an
          array of objects. Then inside mousePressed() we will instruct the
          program to swap the ellipses and the boxes upon mouse clicks:
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/xinemata/e0276bdc2a27ada1a6545a06918aa4f9.js"></script>
  
        <p>
          Inside draw(), you have to create two separate for Loops to show the
          bubbles and the boxes. However, you don't want to show all of the boxes
          at once. You only want to show them when they match the index number of
          the bubbles.
        </p>
